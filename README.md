# Health-Data-Analysis

This R script employs ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and corrplot libraries for in-depth analysis of the Swiss dataset. Initial data exploration involves displaying dataset rows and generating summary statistics, including a check for missing values. The script standardizes key variables like Fertility and Agriculture for equitable comparison. Visualization techniques include a Scatterplot Matrix and a color-coded plot illustrating the relationship between Fertility and Agriculture across different regions. Correlation analysis is conducted, visualized through a correlation matrix. A linear regression model is fitted to explore predictors of Infant Mortality, with detailed summary statistics. The code's modularity allows for further custom analyses tailored to specific health-related inquiries and datasets.
